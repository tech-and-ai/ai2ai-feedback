Okay, here’s a detailed plan for completing the “Roman Legacy” essay task. My goal is to create a robust plan that will allow for a comprehensive and well-executed final product.

*   **Scope and Constraints:**
    *   **Word Count:** 500-800 words.
    *   **Themes:** Must include law, engineering, language, governance, and other significant Roman innovations.  The scope is focused on *influence*, not a complete history of Rome.
    *   **Time Constraint:**  (Let's assume a deadline of one week for this initial planning and execution. This will impact the pacing of each step).

**2. Research Needs:**

*   **Primary Research Questions:**
    1.  How did Roman law principles (e.g., *ius civile*, concepts of justice) influence modern legal systems (e.g., civil law, common law)?
    2.  What specific Roman engineering achievements (e.g., aqueducts, roads, concrete) have had a direct or indirect impact on contemporary infrastructure?
    3.  What Latin roots are prevalent in modern languages, and how did Roman expansion and governance contribute to this linguistic spread?
    4.  How did the Roman Republic’s concepts of citizenship, Senate, and checks and balances shape the development of modern representative democracies?
    5.  Beyond the most obvious examples, are there lesser-known Roman innovations that still have a presence in our daily lives (e.g., calendar systems, architectural styles)?
