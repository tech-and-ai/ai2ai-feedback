**Perspectives & Approaches:**

The sources present a unified view: JSON’s ability to store data in a structured and accessible format is directly linked to improved landing page performance and conversion rates.  Montoya's framework offers a practical approach to building these structures, while the LinkedIn article underscores the importance of a data-centric strategy.

**Consensus & Areas of Agreement:**

There’s a clear consensus that leveraging JSON for landing page content organization is a best practice.  The different approaches – Montoya’s structured framework and the four-step optimization process – converge on the need for a dynamic, data-informed approach.

**Recent Developments/Trends:**

The increasing focus on data-driven marketing and website optimization aligns perfectly with JSON’s capabilities.  While the specific structures may vary based on the website’s goals and complexity, the underlying principle of using JSON to deliver personalized and relevant content is a growing trend.
