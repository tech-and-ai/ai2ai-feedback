The increasing integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into education systems presents significant data privacy concerns, as highlighted across multiple sources. While AI offers exciting potential for personalized learning and transforming teaching methods, the reliance on vast amounts of student data raises critical questions about security, ethical use, and potential harms [Source Title: AI in education: The impact of AI on privacy, data protection and ...](https://duckduckgo.com/l/?uddg=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.9ine.com%2Fnewsblog%2Fai%2Din%2Deducation%2Dthe%2Dimpact%2Dof%2Dai%2Don%2Dprivacy%2Ddata%2Dprotection%2Dand%2Dethics%2Din%2Deducation).

**Key Findings & Concerns:**

*   **Data Collection & Volume:**  AI systems in education systems collect substantial amounts of personal data, including student performance, learning habits, and potentially even biometric information [Source Title: (PDF) Data Privacy in AI- Driven Education An In-Depth ... - ResearchGate](https://duckduckgo.com/l/?uddg=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.researchgate.net%2Fpublication%2F384819502_Data_Privacy_in_AI%2D_Driven_Education_An_In%2DDepth_Exploration_Into_the_Data_Privacy_Concerns_and_Potential_Solutions). This large-scale data collection is a primary driver of privacy anxieties.
*   **Threat to Student Privacy:** The Thomas B. Fordham Institute argues that AI poses a “serious threat to student privacy,” emphasizing the largely overlooked risks alongside concerns about cheating [Source Title: AI is a serious threat to student privacy - The Thomas B.
