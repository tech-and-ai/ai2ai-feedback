## DeepSeek Coder V2: Summary & Key Insights

DeepSeek Coder V2 is an open-source Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) code language model rapidly gaining attention for its performance, aiming to rival models like GPT-4 Turbo in code-related tasks. This summary consolidates information from several sources to address the query regarding its capabilities and limitations, particularly concerning HTML generation, though direct tutorial information on this specific aspect is currently limited.

**Key Findings:**

*   **Performance:** DeepSeek Coder V2 is engineered to achieve performance levels comparable to GPT-4 Turbo in code-specific tasks, thanks to its MoE architecture and extensive training. [Source: deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Instruct)  The model has been pre-trained on a massive dataset, initially 2T tokens, and subsequently expanded to 6 trillion tokens, furthering its capabilities.
*   **Architecture & Training:** Its MoE architecture allows it to focus on relevant parts of the model for a specific query, boosting efficiency. The model was created by scaling up the original DeepSeek-V2 model, demonstrating a strong foundation for code intelligence.
