Okay, here’s a detailed project plan for creating the web page home page landing page for the AI startup, designed to be actionable and thorough. 

## Project Plan: AI Startup Landing Page

**Project Title:** AI Startup Landing Page Development

**Complexity:** 6 (High – Requires UI/UX design, HTML coding, and potentially image sourcing)

**1. Task Analysis**

* **Core Objective:** To create a visually compelling and informative landing page that effectively introduces the AI startup, highlights its value proposition, and encourages visitors to learn more or engage with the company.
* **Key Deliverables:**
    * Functional HTML code for the landing page.
    * A responsive design (adaptable to different screen sizes – desktop, tablet, mobile).
    * Source files (HTML, CSS – potentially image assets, and any necessary JavaScript).
* **Target Audience:**  Potential investors, early adopters of AI technology, and individuals interested in the startup's specific AI applications. (We’ll need to define a *specific* target audience more precisely – e.g., “Small to Medium sized businesses in the marketing industry looking for AI-powered analytics”.)
* **Scope and Constraints:**
    * **Technology:** Primarily HTML, CSS, and potentially some basic JavaScript for interactive elements (e.g., a scrolling animation). We will *not* be using a front-end framework (like React or Vue) to keep the project manageable within this complexity level. 
    * **Visuals:**  The project requires high-quality, visually stunning imagery. We'll need to source or create these.
    * **Time Constraints:**  (To be determined – this plan assumes a 10-14 day project window, but this needs to be finalized).
* **Success Criteria:**
    * The landing page loads quickly (under 3 seconds).
    * The page is responsive and displays correctly on various devices.
    * The core messaging and key features are clearly communicated.
    * The page adheres to the required styling (defined by the provided instructions – "visually stunning").



**2. Research Needs**

* **Primary Research Questions:**
    1. What are current design trends in AI startup landing pages? (Focus on visual styles, user engagement techniques)
    2. What are effective hero statement templates for AI businesses? (Consider value proposition, problem-solving, and benefits)
    3. What are the most impactful visuals to use when showcasing AI technology? (e.g., abstract representations of data, user interfaces)
    4. What pricing strategies and visuals are commonly used in the AI industry? 
    5. What are best practices for contact information placement on landing pages? 

* **Key Topics to Investigate:**
    * Landing Page Design Trends (UI/UX)
    * AI Startup Branding & Messaging
    * Visual Design Principles (color theory, typography, layout)
    * Responsive Web Design Techniques
    * HTML5 Structure and Semantic HTML
    * Accessibility (WCAG guidelines - basic level to ensure the page is usable by everyone)

* **Types of Sources Needed:**
    * **Academic Research:** Articles on UI/UX design principles.
    * **News & Industry Blogs:**  Articles on AI startup trends, design best practices, and successful landing page examples.
    * **Statistics:** Data on website loading speeds, conversion rates, and user behavior.
    * **Competitor Analysis:** Examining landing pages of similar AI startups.
    * **Design Resource Websites:** Dribbble, Behance, Awwwards for visual inspiration.

* **Specific Search Terms:**
    * “AI startup landing page design trends”
    * “Hero statement examples AI”
    * “Visuals for AI technology”
    * “Responsive web design best practices”
    * “HTML5 landing page template”
