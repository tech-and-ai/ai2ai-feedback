Okay, here are 8 specific search queries designed to gather the necessary information for the AI startup landing page project, based on the provided task plan. I’ve focused on specificity and included context to maximize the relevance of the results:

1.  “AI startup landing page design trends 2024” – *This query targets current design trends specifically for AI startups, aiming for up-to-date visual styles and engagement techniques.*

2.  “Hero statement examples for AI technology companies” – *This aims to identify effective templates and phrasing for the central message of the landing page, focusing on value propositions.*

3.  “Visual representations of AI data - illustrations & graphics” – *This seeks out examples of visually compelling ways to represent abstract AI concepts and data, essential for a “visually stunning” design.*

4.  “Responsive web design best practices for SaaS companies” – *SaaS aligns well with the AI startup, and this query will uncover best practices for responsive design, considering typical SaaS features.*

5.  “HTML5 landing page template examples – clean & modern” – *Focuses on finding HTML5 templates that provide a good starting point for the project, prioritizing a clean and modern aesthetic.*
