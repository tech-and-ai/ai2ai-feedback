This legal requirement underscores the seriousness of implementing accessibility best practices.
*   **WCAG 2.2 as an Interim Measure:** WCAG 2.2 is currently a vital interim standard, providing updated guidance due to the rapid pace of web development since the publication of WCAG 2.0 [Source: Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 - GitHub Pages](https://w3c.github.io/wcag/guidelines/22/). The Working Group recognizes a need for ongoing, updated standards to maintain relevance.
*   **Design Principles at the Core:**  WCAG 2.2 is structured around four core design principles: perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust [Source: Understanding WCAG 2.2 - Service Manual - GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/service/manual/understanding-wcag). These principles guide the creation of inclusive user experiences.
*   **Ongoing Evolution:**  The accessibility landscape is constantly changing.  The W3C’s Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) actively monitors and updates WCAG guidelines to adapt to new technologies and user needs [Source: WCAG 2 Overview | WAI | W3C](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards/guidelines/wcag/).

**Important Quotes & Statistics:**

*   “Services must achieve WCAG 2.2 level AA as part of meeting government accessibility requirements." – GOV.UK [Source: Understanding WCAG 2.2 - Service Manual - GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/service/manual/understanding-wcag)

**Relevance to Landing Page Design:**

Landing pages, being the initial point of contact with a website, require particularly stringent accessibility.  Ensuring compliance with WCAG 2.2 directly impacts the usability and overall experience for a broad audience, including users with disabilities. Prioritizing elements like sufficient color contrast, alternative text for images, keyboard navigation, and clear, understandable content are paramount.  The goal is to create a landing page that is equally accessible and engaging for *all* visitors.
