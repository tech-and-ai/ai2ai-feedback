## Synthesis of Classical Architectural Orders – Doric, Ionic, Corinthian Influence

This synthesis consolidates information from multiple sources regarding the classical architectural orders, specifically focusing on the Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian styles and their enduring influence. The core concept revolves around these orders as standardized systems of architectural design originating in ancient Greece and Rome, characterized by specific proportions and decorative elements that have continued to impact architectural design across eras.

**Key Findings & Perspectives:**

*   **The Three Primary Orders:** The dominant architectural orders are the Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian, representing the foundational styles developed by the Greeks and later adopted and adapted by the Romans.

*   **Doric Characteristics:** The Doric order is the simplest, most robust, and most squat of the three, traditionally lacking a base and resting directly on the stylobate.
