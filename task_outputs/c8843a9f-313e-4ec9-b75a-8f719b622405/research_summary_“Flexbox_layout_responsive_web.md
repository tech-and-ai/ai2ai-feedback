**Key Findings & Concepts:**

*   **Flexbox Definition & Purpose:**  Flexbox (Flexible Box Layout) is a layout module within CSS designed to simplify the creation of flexible, responsive layouts [Source Title: CSS Flexbox (Flexible Box Layout) - W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/csS/css3_flexbox.asp). It fundamentally alters how elements are arranged, allowing designers to easily control how elements size and position themselves based on screen size.  The core idea is distributing space dynamically between flexible items.
*   **Addressing Layout Challenges:** All sources acknowledge that Flexbox provides a superior solution to older layout techniques like floats and positioning, which are often complex and difficult to manage responsively [Source Title: Master CSS Flexbox: Build Responsive Layouts Like a Pro!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHXbVGeJdmo).
*   **Responsive Design Core:**  Flexbox is integral to responsive web design.  “Understanding CSS Flexbox is super helpful if you want to make your websites responsive” [Source Title: Learn CSS Flexbox in This Crash Course - freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-css-flexbox/). This emphasizes its built-in adaptability to different screen sizes.
*   **Key Properties:** The sources consistently highlight key Flexbox properties:
    *   `flex-grow`: Controls how much an item expands relative to other items.
    *   `flex-shrink`: Controls how much an item contracts relative to other items.
    *   `flex-basis`: Sets the initial size of an item.
