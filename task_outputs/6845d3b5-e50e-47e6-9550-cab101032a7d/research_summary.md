## Research Summary: Responsive Layouts & Image Galleries

**Executive Summary:**

This research focuses on creating responsive layouts and image galleries, particularly utilizing Flexbox and CSS Grid. A recurring theme is the centrality of Flexbox for adapting layouts to various screen sizes, coupled with the strategic use of media queries. The core methodology involves leveraging Flexbox’s container properties to control element arrangement and responsiveness. Significant advancements include combining Flexbox with CSS Grid for even more precise control over layout and placement, alongside the integration of modern CSS properties like `aspect-ratio` and `object-fit`.  A key finding is the preference for HTML and CSS-based solutions over JavaScript, promoting efficient and maintainable code.
