# Proposed Research Pack Structure

## Overview

This document outlines a streamlined, student-focused structure for Lily AI research packs. The current structure is bloated with unnecessary content that students don't need or use. This proposal eliminates filler and focuses on delivering what students actually want: usable content they can leverage for their assignments.

## Core Principles

1. **Eliminate fluff** - Remove redundant sections and "how to use" instructions
2. **Prioritize usable content** - Focus on material students can directly incorporate
3. **Maintain academic rigor** - Ensure all content is well-researched and properly cited
4. **Optimize for actual student behavior** - Students want answers and evidence, not process guides

## Proposed Structure

### 1. Introduction (500-750 words)
- **Topic Overview** - Clear, concise explanation of the topic
- **Key Questions Addressed** - Bullet points of the main questions this pack answers
- **Academic Context** - Brief positioning of the topic within its academic field
- **No fluff** - Eliminate "how to use this document" and other padding

### 2. Topic Analysis (5000-7000 words)
- **Core Concepts** - Thorough explanation of fundamental concepts
- **Historical Context** - Relevant background and development of the topic
- **Current State of Research** - Where the academic conversation stands today
- **Theoretical Frameworks** - Major theories and models relevant to the topic
- **Interdisciplinary Perspectives** - How different fields approach this topic
- **Key Debates** - Major points of contention in the field

### 3. Methodological Approaches (3000-4000 words)
- **Research Methods Overview** - Summary of applicable methods
- **Quantitative Approaches** - Relevant statistical and numerical methods
- **Qualitative Approaches** - Relevant interpretive and descriptive methods
- **Mixed Methods** - How to combine approaches effectively
- **Data Collection Techniques** - Specific techniques relevant to the topic
- **Analytical Frameworks** - How to structure analysis of findings

### 4. Key Arguments (5000-7000 words)
- **Main Position 1**
  - Thorough explanation
  - Supporting evidence
  - Academic sources
  - Counter-arguments and rebuttals
- **Main Position 2**
  - (Same structure as above)
- **Main Position 3**
  - (Same structure as above)
- **Synthesis of Positions**
  - How these arguments relate to each other
  - Areas of consensus and disagreement
  - Emerging perspectives

### 5. Citations and Resources (1000-2000 words)
- **Annotated Bibliography** - Key sources with brief descriptions
- **Primary Sources** - Original research and data
- **Secondary Sources** - Analysis and interpretation by scholars
- **Contemporary Sources** - Recent research and developments
- **Opposing Viewpoints** - Sources representing different perspectives
- **Citation Format Examples** - How to cite these sources in different styles

## Total Word Count: 15,000-20,000 words

## What's Been Eliminated

1. ~~How to Use This Document~~ - Unnecessary padding
2. ~~Research Journey Map~~ - Students don't need this
3. ~~Writing Templates~~ - Students rarely use these
4. ~~Paragraph Planners~~ - More filler content
5. ~~One-Week Crash Plans~~ - Not what students are paying for
6. ~~Academic Style Guide~~ - Generic content available elsewhere
7. ~~Peer Review Checklists~~ - Not relevant to most students' needs
8. ~~Literature Review Matrices~~ - Too generic to be useful
9. ~~Thesis Builders~~ - Students want content, not tools

## Benefits of This Structure

1. **Focused Value** - Every section provides directly usable content
2. **Higher Quality** - Resources concentrated on fewer, better sections
3. **Better Student Outcomes** - Students get what they actually need
4. **Reduced Production Costs** - Less content to generate means more resources for quality
5. **Clearer Value Proposition** - "Here's what you need to know" vs. "Here are some tools"

## Implementation Notes

- Maintain the same high-quality research standards
- Ensure proper citations throughout
- Include Lily Callouts within each section for additional insights
- Focus on depth rather than breadth
- Ensure diagrams and visual aids are integrated where they add value, not as padding
