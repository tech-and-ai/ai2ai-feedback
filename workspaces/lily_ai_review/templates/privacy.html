                <p>We may share your information with third-party vendors, service providers, and other third parties who perform services for us or on our behalf, such as payment processing, data analysis, email delivery, hosting, and customer service.</p>

                <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mt-8 mb-4">5. Data Retention</h2>
                <p>We will retain your personal information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.</p>

                <h3 class="text-lg font-medium text-gray-900 dark:text-white mt-6 mb-3">5.1. Account Deletion</h3>
                <p>When you delete your account, we take the following steps:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
                    <li>We deactivate your account and you will no longer be able to log in</li>
                    <li>We anonymize your personal information (name, email, etc.)</li>
                    <li>We cancel any active subscriptions</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="text-lg font-medium text-gray-900 dark:text-white mt-6 mb-3">5.2. Data Retention After Account Deletion</h3>
                <p>For legal, security, and fraud prevention purposes, we retain certain anonymized data for a limited period after account deletion:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
                    <li><strong>Research Papers and Content:</strong> We retain research papers and content in anonymized form for up to 24 months for legal compliance, fraud prevention, and service improvement purposes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Usage Records:</strong> We retain anonymized usage records for up to 24 months for security monitoring and fraud prevention.</li>
                    <li><strong>Payment Records:</strong> We retain payment records as required by financial regulations (typically 7 years) but in a form that cannot be linked to your personal identity.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This retention is necessary to:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
                    <li>Comply with legal obligations</li>
                    <li>Prevent fraud and abuse</li>
                    <li>Resolve disputes</li>
                    <li>Address technical issues</li>
                    <li>Respond to legal requests from authorities</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mt-8 mb-4">6. Security</h2>
                <p>We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the security of your personal information. However, please be aware that no security system is impenetrable, and we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information.</p>

                <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mt-8 mb-4">7. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
                <p>Depending on your location, you may have certain rights regarding your personal information, including:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
                    <li>Right to access personal information we hold about you</li>
                    <li>Right to request correction of inaccurate information</li>
                    <li>Right to request deletion of your information</li>
                    <li>Right to object to or restrict processing of your information</li>
                    <li>Right to data portability</li>
                    <li>Right to withdraw consent</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="text-lg font-medium text-gray-900 dark:text-white mt-6 mb-3">7.1. Right to Erasure (Right to be Forgotten)</h3>
                <p>You have the right to request the deletion of your personal data. However, this right is not absolute and may be limited by:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
                    <li>Legal obligations that require us to retain certain data</li>
                    <li>Legitimate interests such as fraud prevention and security</li>
                    <li>The establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims</li>
                </ul>
                <p>When you exercise your right to erasure, we will anonymize your personal information rather than completely deleting all data, as explained in our Data Retention policy. This approach balances your privacy rights with our legal obligations.</p>

                <p>To exercise these rights, please contact us using the details provided in the "Contact Us" section.</p>
